Consider the reaction at equilibrium:

$$
\mathrm{A} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{B}
$$

where A is the un-paired RNA, and B is the paired RNA.

The reaction equilibrium constant is given by:

$$
K_{\mathrm{eq}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{B}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{A}\right]}
$$

Free energy difference between standard temperature $\Delta G_{0}$ and temperature $T$ $\Delta G$ is given by:

$$
\Delta G=\Delta G_{0}+R T \ln K_{\mathrm{eq}}
$$

where $R$ is the gas constant.
